This is the legacy way to hold hard coded dependencies.

At first look, there seems nothing wrong with above implementation. But above code logic has certain limitations:

1) MyApplication class is responsible to initialize the email service and then use it.
This leads to hard-coded dependency. If we want to switch to some other advanced email service in future, it will require code changes
in MyApplication class. This makes our application hard to extend and if email service is used in multiple classes then that would be even more harder.

2) If we want to extend our application to provide additional messaging feature, such as SMS or Facebook message then we would need
 to write another application for that. This will involve code changes in application classes and in client classes too.

3) Testing the application will be very difficult since our application is directly creating the email service instance.
There is no way we can mock these objects in our test classes.
